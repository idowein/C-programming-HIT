# C Programming Course - HIT

This repository contains all the code I developed during my introductory C programming course at Holon Institute of Technology (HIT). The course covered fundamental C programming concepts, progressing from basic program structure to more advanced topics.

**Course Topics:**

* **Fundamentals:** Program structure, data types, input/output, arithmetic and logical expressions.
* **Control Flow:** Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`), loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), control transfer (`continue`, `break`).
* **Functions:** Function definitions, calls, and parameter passing.
* **Arrays:** One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, passing arrays to functions, sorting algorithms.
* **Pointers:** Pointer basics and advanced usage.
* **Strings:** String manipulation.
* **Memory Management:** Dynamic memory allocation.
* **Structures:** User-defined data structures.
* **Header Files & Libraries:** Use of standard C libraries and creating custom header files.
* **Recursion:** Implementation of recursive functions.

**Repository Contents:**

This repository is organized to reflect the weekly progression of the course. Each week's code examples and assignments are included, demonstrating my understanding and application of the concepts learned.

**Purpose:**

This repository serves as a portfolio of my C programming skills acquired during the course. It showcases my ability to write C code, solve programming problems, and implement algorithms.

**Note:**

The code in this repository was developed as part of an educational course and may not represent production-level code.
